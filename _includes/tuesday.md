  - [Command-Line Bootcamp](https://cli-boot.camp/)

P.S. Sites like [hackertyper.com](http://www.hackertyper.com/) and [geektyper.com](https://geektyper.com/fsociety/) can sometimes be fun, but it can sometimes make it feel daunting to start using the CLI. Hopefully you'll see it isn't so intimidating :)

###### `02:00 – 02:15pm` *15m Break* <a href="https://asoftmurmur.com/"><i class="far fa-play-circle"></i></a>

###### `02:15 – 03:00pm` Command Line, Part 2

In this part, we will use what we have learned to log into the CLI of one of our CS lab computers and solve a command-line murder mystery.

This is an *optional* social. We will play [Quiplash 2](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash-two/) using [the same Zoom meeting](https://usfca.zoom.us/j/93175178704) room as before.

*P.S. We will get the social kicked off, but the professor(s) will leave after 15 minutes for the rest of you to enjoy the game.*
