Time for a social break! We will break into small groups and participate in a social activity.

Here are the instructions for the "Recent/Favorite Thing" exercise:

  1. Re-introduce yourself to everyone in the breakout room. Include your name and hometown.

  1. Choose an activity. This can be either watching TV shows, watching movies, listening to music, playing video games or board games, or another activity.

  1. Share with the group the most recent of that activity you participated in, then share your favorite of that activity. For example:

      > I choose watching movies. The last movie I watched was Old Guard on Netflix. My favorite movie to watch is currently Arrival.

  1. If anyone else mentions one of your last or favorite activity before you do, you need to choose a new activity!

      > I was also going to say the last movie I watched was Old Guard! I will choose playing video games instead. The last video game I played was Last of Us 2. My favorite video game is Portal (1 and 2).

When everyone has participated, feel free to get up, stretch, and take a short break. Or, continue to socialize in the breakout room or return to the main room.
